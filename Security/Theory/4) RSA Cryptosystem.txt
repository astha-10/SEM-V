### RSA Cryptosystem:
The RSA algorithm is a widely-used asymmetric encryption method that uses two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Its security is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.

Key Generation:
1. Choose two large prime numbers, \( p \) and \( q \). Calculate \( n = p \times q \).
2. Calculate phi(n) = (p-1) x (q-1).
3. Select a public key (e) such that (e) and phi(n) are coprime.
4. Determine the private key (d) such that (e x d)mod phi(n) = 1 

**Encryption**: C = M^e mod n
**Decryption**: M = C^d mod n
Where (M) is the message and (C) is the encrypted message.

### Digital Signature with RSA:
1. **Signing**: Hash the message and encrypt the hash with the private key to create a signature.
2. **Verification**: Decrypt the signature using the senderâ€™s public key. Compare the result with the hash of the received message. If they match, the signature is verified.
