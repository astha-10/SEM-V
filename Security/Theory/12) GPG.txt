### GPG for Email Security:

**GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)** is a tool for encrypting, decrypting, and signing emails to provide **confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity**. It uses **asymmetric encryption** with a public and private key pair.

### Key Features:
- **Encryption**: Encrypt emails using the recipient's public key to keep content private.
- **Digital Signatures**: Sign emails with your private key to verify your identity and ensure the message hasnâ€™t been altered.

### Basic Steps:
1. **Generate keys**: Create a key pair using `gpg --gen-key`.
2. **Share public key**: Send or publish your public key.
3. **Encrypt**: Use `gpg -e -r [recipient]` to encrypt the email.
4. **Sign**: Sign with `gpg --sign`.

GPG ensures secure and authenticated email communication.
