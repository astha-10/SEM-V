Mono-alphabetic Substitution Cipher:
A mono-alphabetic substitution cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a corresponding letter in the ciphertext using a fixed mapping or key. Unlike polyalphabetic ciphers, which use multiple substitution alphabets, mono-alphabetic ciphers rely on a single substitution alphabet for encryption.

Substitution Alphabet: 
	In a mono-alphabetic cipher, each letter of the plaintext alphabet is mapped to a unique letter in the ciphertext alphabet. For example, if 'A' is 
mapped to 'D', then every occurrence of 'A' in the plaintext will be replaced by 'D' in the ciphertext. 

Key:
	The key in a mono-alphabetic cipher is the substitution alphabet itself. This can be represented as a sequence of 26 letters that shows the mapping from plaintext to ciphertext letters. 

Encryption and Decryption: 
	o Encryption: To encrypt a message, replace each letter in the plaintext with the corresponding letter in the ciphertext alphabet based on the key. 
	o Decryption: To decrypt a message, replace each letter in the ciphertext with the corresponding letter in the plaintext alphabet based on the inverse of the key.
